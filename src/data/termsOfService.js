  <p>
  DO NOT USE THE PLATFORM OR PLATFORM SERVICES FOR MEDICAL EMERGENCIES. IF YOU HAVE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY OR ATTEND THE EMERGENCY ROOM OF THE NEAREST HOSPITAL OR HEALTH CENTRE.
  </p>
  <p>
  IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT SUICIDE OR IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING TAKING ACTIONS THAT MAY CAUSE HARM TO YOU OR TO OTHERS, OR IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON MAY BE IN ANY DANGER, OR IF YOU HAVE ANY MEDICAL EMERGENCY, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY CALL THE EMERGENCY SERVICE NUMBER AND NOTIFY THE RELEVANT AUTHORITIES. THE ALLI SITE DISPLAYS THE SUICIDE HOTLINE IN SEVERAL PROMINENT LOCATIONS AND HAS AN INDEX OF NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND STATE RESOURCES FOR MENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCIES, WHICH WE IMPLORE ALL USERS OF THIS SITE TO USE WHEN FACED WITH AN IMMEDIATE OR EMERGENT CRISIS.
  </p>
  <p>
  ANY PAYMENT TO ALLI FOR THE USE OF THE PLATFORM IS FOR ACCESS TO THE SERVICES OF MENTAL HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONERS OR ANY OTHER SERVICES MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PLATFORM THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY EXTENDED HEALTH INSURANCE. REGARDLESS OF ANY PAYMENTS MADE, ALLI DOES NOT HOLD ITSELF OUT AS A DIRECT PROVIDER OF THERAPY SERVICES, AS THAT IS THE ROLE OF YOUR LICENSED, ACCREDITED PROVIDER.
  </p>
  <p>
  The following Terms of Service (the “<b>Terms of Service</b>”) form an agreement between Alli Therapy Inc. (“<b>Alli</b>”) and you, and such Terms of Service will govern your use (the term ‘<b>use</b>’ will mean access or use, as applicable) of the Alli online platform (the “<b>App</b>”) (collectively the “<b>Platform</b>”). The Platform provides you with access to Mental Health Services and Information Tools (defined below) (collectively the “<b>Platform Services</b>”). Collectively, the Terms of Service together with the Privacy Policy (the “<b>Privacy Policy</b>”) govern the Agreement (the “<b>Agreement</b>”) between the parties.
  </p>
  <p>
  The term “you” refers to the person or entity using the Platform or receiving any Platform Services. By accessing the website, using or subscribing to the Platform Services, or tendering a similar form of electronic acceptance, you agree with these Terms of Service. If you do not accept and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service, do not use the Platform.
  </p>
  <p>
  Alli reserves the right to amend any term of these Terms of Service at any time by giving 30 days’ notice. Any notices regarding modifications to these Terms of Service will be in a written form and provided to you: (i) by Alli via email (in each case to the address that you provide); and/or (ii) via the Platform. For notices provided by email, the date on which such notice is transmitted will be deemed the date of receipt. You are not obliged to continue using the Platform Services after an amendment to these Terms of Service is made; however, in the event you choose to not accept the changes, you must immediately cease use of the Platform and the Platform Services and provide notice to Alli that you are terminating your agreement to these Terms of Service. Cancellation fees may apply. Your continued use of the Platform Services following any amendment shall be deemed to be your acceptance of the amended Terms of Service, and waiver of any additional notice requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
  Alli reserves the right to change any information, material or content (the “<b>Content</b>”) contained on or provided through the Platform at any time, and from time to time, without notice. Content does not include your Personal Health Information (“<b>PHI</b>”) or your Personal Information (“<b>PI</b>”).
  </p>
  <h5>Use of Platform</h5>
  <p>
  Alli grants you a personal, revocable, non-exclusive and non-transferable license to permit you to use the Platform, including downloading and installing the App on your personal mobile phone device for the purpose of accessing the Platform Services in accordance with these Terms of Service.
  </p>
  <p>
  As a condition of your use of the Platform, you warrant that: (1) you are 18 years of age or older; (2) you possess the legal authority to create a binding legal obligation; (3) you will use the Platform in accordance with these Terms of Service; (4) all information supplied by you on the Platform is true, accurate, current and complete; and (5) if you are accessing or using the Platform on behalf of another person or a corporate entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind such person or entity to these Terms of Service.
  </p>
  <p>
  The Platform is provided solely (the "<b>Permitted Use</b>") to: (1) give you access to any services offered to you through the Platform, including access to the Mental Health Services provided by Mental Health Practitioners, as well as the other educational graphics, research sources, workshops, meetups, and other incidental information on the Platform; (2) if applicable, facilitate any payments from you to Alli in respect of your use of the Platform or the receipt of any services through the Platform; and (3) provide feedback and otherwise communicate with Alli in connection with any of the foregoing.
  </p>
  <p>
  Additionally, you agree not to access or use the Service in an unlawful way or for an unlawful or illegitimate purpose or in any manner that contravenes these terms. You shall not post, use, store or transmit: (i) a message or information under a false name; (ii) information that is unlawful, libelous, defamatory, obscene, fraudulent, predatory of minors, harassing, threatening or hateful to any person; or (iii) information that infringes or violates any of the intellectual property rights of others or the privacy or publicity rights of others. You shall not attempt to disrupt the operation of the Service by any method, including through use of viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, denial of service attacks, flooding or spamming. You shall not use the Service in any manner that could damage, disable or impair the Service. You shall not attempt to gain unauthorized access to any user accounts or computer systems or networks through hacking, password mining, or any other means. You shall not use any robot, scraper or other means to access the Service for any purpose. Neither Alli nor its affiliates are under any obligation to respond to messages posted on the Service. You are solely responsible for the information or material you post on the Service.
  </p>
  <p>
  If Alli deems that you have used the Platform in any manner contrary to the Permitted Use, or if you have violated any of these Terms of Service, Alli retains the right to deny you further access to the Platform or the Platform Services it offers, at any time and in its sole discretion.
  </p>
  <h5>Site Content</h5>
  <p>
  Other than the guidance and advice you receive directly from your licensed Provider, the other Content on the website, including educational graphics, research sources, and other incidental information should not be considered mental health advice. You should always talk to an appropriately qualified Mental Healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment, including information regarding which medications or treatment may be appropriate for you. None of the Content represents or warrants that any particular medication or treatment is safe, appropriate, or effective for you. Alli does not endorse any specific tests, medications, products, or procedures.
  </p>
  <h5>Platform Services</h5>
  <p>Health and Wellness Services:</p>
  <p>
  The Platform Services enable you to obtain access to healthcare professionals, which may include Social Workers, Psychotherapists, Resident Therapists and Counsellors (“<b>Mental Healthcare Practitioners</b>”) and other professionals (“<b>Wellness Practitioners</b>”) as they become available. This access includes video or audio appointments for consultations, and receiving professional and administrative support services virtually.
  </p>
  <p>
  Where applicable, Mental Healthcare Practitioners and Wellness Practitioners on the Platform are licensed or accredited to practice by the applicable regulatory authority governing their profession in the province or territory of Canada where they practice. For greater certainty, you will be provided with access to consultations with Mental Healthcare Practitioners provided through the Platform. Any payment to Alli through the Platform, either paid personally or through Extended Health Insurance, is for access to the services of Healthcare Practitioners and Wellness Practitioners made available through the Platform.
  </p>
  <p>
  Mental Healthcare Practitioners and Wellness Practitioners are independent of Alli and are solely responsible for the provision of Mental Health and Wellness Services to you. The relationship between you and the Mental Healthcare Practitioner providing Mental Health and Wellness Services is a patient-practitioner relationship. Alli is not party to that relationship as it relates to the delivery of such Mental Health and Wellness Services, and Alli is not engaged in the practice of therapy, the practice of pyschotherapy or the practice of any other regulated health profession for the purpose of providing Mental Health and Wellness Services in your use of the Platform. Neither Alli nor any other party associated with Alli (other than the applicable Mental Healthcare Practitioner or Wellness Practitioner) are liable for any Mental Health Services provided to you by Mental Healthcare Practitioners or Wellness Practitioners in your use of the Platform.
  </p>
  <p>
  Alli does not guarantee the availability of any particular Mental Healthcare Practitioner at any particular time. We will do what we can to arrange a consultation with a Mental Healthcare Practitioner as soon as possible, but do not guarantee to offer consultations within a particular time frame.
  </p>
  <p>
  Information Tools:
  </p>
  <p>
  The Platform provides access to various mental health and wellness informational tools, including workshops, meetups, and additional features and tools provided from time to time, as further described on the Platform (“<b>Information Tools</b>”). The Information Tools are available for use at any time, independently of the services provided by either Healthcare Practitioners or Wellness Practitioners.
  </p>
  <p>
  Any Information Tools, unless stated otherwise, provide health and wellness information and not mental health advice, diagnosis and/or treatment. If you choose to submit information about your symptoms using the Information Tools, the information returned to you is general health information. Our Information Tools are not a substitute for a doctor or other licensed healthcare or mental health professional.
  </p>
  <p>Other Limitations:</p>
  <p>
  The Content provided through the Platform (except as may be directly communicated to you by Mental Healthcare Practitioners) is not medical or clinical advice. The Content and the Information Tools were not designed or personalised for you specifically. Alli does not make any endorsement, representation or warranty regarding the safety, appropriateness or effectiveness of the Content or the Information Tools, or of any particular diagnosis or treatment communicated to you by the Mental Healthcare Practitioners.
  </p>
  <h5>
  Geographic Application of the Platform
  </h5>
  <p>
  The Platform is made available for use in Canada only. By signing the Terms of Service you represent and warrant that you are and will be in Canada when using our Platform. If you access the Platform from outside Canada, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws.
  </p>
  <h5>Account Enrollment</h5>
  <p>
  To access the Services, you must first enroll to establish an individual user account (“<b>Account</b>”), by providing certain information. You agree that you will not create more than one Account, nor create an Account for anyone other than yourself without first receiving permission from the other person. In exchange for your use of the Service and, if applicable, in order for providers to send notices to you, you agree to: (i) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by our Account enrollment form; and (ii) each time you log on, maintain and promptly update such Account information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or if Alli has reasonable grounds to suspect that such Account information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Alli reserves the right to terminate your account and refuse any future request(s) to use the Alli Services. You shall at all times remain responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account password and username (if any) and any other security information related to your Account. Alli will not be liable for any loss that you incur as a result of someone else accessing and using your Account, either with or without your knowledge.
  </p>
  <h5>Extended Health Insurance</h5>
  <p>
  In addition to the registration described above, access to the Services through an Employer sponsored benefit plan or other extended insurance plans may require you to provide additional registration information. When applicable, your Employer or the Employer of the subscriber of your benefits will not be provided this information (you likely already gave them similar information in your employee file unless you are a family member of an eligible employee), and your employer will not be told you or your family member are using the Services, unless such information is shared by you or part of a pre-arranged special program. Further, Alli may communicate directly with your insurance provider on your behalf to determine your insurance eligibility and your specific benefits. BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU ARE PROVIDING EXPRESS AUTHORIZATION TO ALLI TO CONTACT YOUR INSURANCE PROVIDER ON YOUR BEHALF AND YOU AGREE TO PROVIDE ALLI WITH THE REQUISITE INFORMATION REQUIRED BY YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY. YOU CAN WITHDRAW YOUR CONSENT AT ANY TIME. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Information collected under these circumstances may include, but is not limited to:
  </p>
  <u>
    <li>First Name</li>
    <li>Last Name</li>
    <li>Email</li>
    <li>Date of Birth</li>
    <li>Phone number</li>
    <li>Relationship with claimant (yourself, or the spouse, domestic partner, or dependent of an employee in certain programs)</li>
    <li>Employer’s name</li>
  </u>
  <p>Alli may request additional information from time to time.</p>
  <h5>Payment</h5>
  <p>
  Any payment you make for the use of the Services is used to compensate Alli for its software development, overhead, administrative services and other corporate costs and fees, including transaction fees for credit card usage.
  </p>
  <p>
  Part of your payment for the use of the Services is remitted to the Provider for the direct clinical services provided to you. Regardless of any payments made, Alli does not hold itself out as your direct provider of therapy services, as that is the role of your licensed, network-accredited Provider. You agree to pay all fees and charges associated with your Account on a timely basis in accordance with the fee schedule, and the terms and rates published by Alli from time to time. The full amount of fees and charges (including any taxes and late fees, as applicable) may be charged to your credit card or debit card after every session. You agree to maintain valid credit card information in your Account. By providing Alli with credit card information, you authorize Alli to bill and charge your credit card for services rendered, in accordance with the fee schedule in place at the time.
  </p>
  <p>
  Insurance receipts will be provided to you for the purpose of submitting your insurance claim(s) to your insurance provider(s).
  </p>
  <p>
  If you access the Services through Extended Health Insurance, an Employer sponsored benefit plan, or other insurance-backed plan and direct billing is available, your payment may be arranged by a third party payor, which is a third party that administers or insures the benefit program you are a member of through your employer. In this instance, you may still be responsible for co-payment or payment for additional services, which is explained in your benefit program.
  </p>
  <h5>Intellectual Property</h5>
  <p>
  All of the content available on or through the Service is the property of Alli, and is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property law. You agree not to reproduce, retransmit, distribute, disseminate, sell, publish, broadcast, or circulate the content received through the Service to any third party. All software and accompanying documentation made available for download from the Service is the copyrighted work of Alli.
  </p>
  <p>
  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Alli hereby grants you a limited, revocable, non-transferable and non-exclusive license to use the software, network facilities, content and documentation on and in the Service to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to access and use the Service.
  </p>
  <p>
  The license granted herein does not permit you to, and you agree not to: (i) modify, translate, reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile or create derivative works of the Service or allow a third party, whether directly or indirectly (including, but not limited to the direct or indirect use of wizards, agents, bots, or other utilities), to modify, translate, reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile or create derivative works of the Service; or (ii) transfer, distribute, sell, lease, rent, disclose or provide access to the Service to any third party or use the Service to provide service bureau, time sharing or other services to third parties.
  </p>
  <h5>Third Party Hyperlinks and Websites</h5>
  <p>
  The Platform may provide links (including, but not limited to, a hyperlink, button or referral device of any kind) to third party websites. These links are provided for your convenience only. The appearance of a link does not constitute an endorsement, recommendation or certification by Alli. Alli does not endorse the information contained on any third-party websites or guarantee their quality, accuracy, reliability, completeness, currency, timeliness, non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for any purpose.
