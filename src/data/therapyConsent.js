  This consent to counselling and psychotherapy services documents that I, give permission and consent to Alli Therapists to provide counselling and/or psychotherapy services to me/us and /or my child/ren: In accordance with his/her professional assessment and aligned with the following legislation, policies and expectations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Situation in which my therapist or Alli may be legally obligated to release my information without consent include:
  </p>
  <h5>Personal Health Information Protection Act and Circle of Care</h5>
  <p>
    I understand that my information may be shared on an as needed basis with other health care providers working directly with me if that information is needed to provide me care. I understand I have the right to decline having information shared with other members of my care team, and I understand that this can impair the coordination of my care in some cases. If I have members of my care team outside of Alli with whom I would like information shared, I may request that my therapist share information and understand that I may be required to sign a consent form to release this information.
  </p>
  <p>
    I understand that psychotherapy best practice involves regular case consultation among therapists, and consent to my therapist seeking consultation from the Alli therapist team. I understand that all consultation meetings are held via secure and confidential means video conference meeting the requirements of the Personal Health Information Protection Act.
  </p>
  <h5>
    Documentation of Personal Information
  </h5>
  <p>
    I understand that my therapist is required by their professional regulatory body to document relevant data related to our sessions. My therapist will write a short note following the session documenting the theme of the session, their observations, any actions taken, progress made etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    I understand that the staff of Alli may need to access some personal information in order to administer the program. This does not include clinical records but may include demographic data. This will not be shared outside of Alli unless legally required as outlined above.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a right to review my clinical record and can request to view it for a small printing fee.
  </p>
  <p>
    My record will be kept on a secure electronic health record in compliance with all relevant privacy legislation.
  </p>
  <p>
    My record will be kept for ten years following my completion of services, at which point it may be destroyed in accordance with PHIPA standards.
  </p>
  <h5>
    Appointment times
  </h5>
  <p>
    Appointment times will be determined between me and my therapist. A standard session runs 50 minutes. My therapist and I will discuss how often to meet, and what times work for us both at our first appointment. The number of sessions depends on my therapy goals and can be discussed for estimate with my therapist after initial assessment.
  </p>
  <h5>Fees and payment for services</h5>
  <p>
    I will be provided with a receipt with my therapist's name and registration number following my appointment.This receipt can then be provided to my insurer for reimbursement if I have insurance coverage.
  </p>
  <h5>
    Cancelled and Missed Appointments
  </h5>
  <p>
    I understand the frequent missed or cancelled appointment will impact the effectiveness of my therapy. I commit to giving my therapist at least 24 hours’ notice of cancellation. Appointments cancelled within the 24 hour period will be subject to a full appointment fee.
  </p>
  <p>
    *Please note that an insurance receipt will not be issued in this instance.
  </p>
  <h5>
    Virtual Therapy
  </h5>
  <p>
    Accessing virtual services allows me greater choice of therapists with skills matching my needs, and limits travel time. Virtual therapy is convenient and effective, and most therapy provided by Alli is delivered via secure video conferencing. I understand that the secure platform used meets all requirements of the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004 (PHIPA). As with all technology, while there are convenience benefits, I also acknowledge that there can be security risks to confidential information despite using a highly secure platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our platform meets our professional privacy and confidentiality standards. We may, from time to time, use other similar web platforms with equivalent or superior privacy and confidentiality standards. In order to access the video session you simply need to click on the link emailed to you the day prior to your session. You enter your name to the prompt and then we will connect with you when your session is due to start. You do not need to download any application or install any software.
  </p>
  <h5>Technology Requirements</h5>
  <p>
    You will need a computer with secure internet access (e.g., not public wifi) and webcam ability. You will need a quiet, private space for your session time. You will also need access to a phone in the same room. You will need to provide your psychologist with your phone number and location. This ensures that if the video session is interrupted for any reason, we can switch to phone connection to complete the session. Providing your location ensures that in case of a crisis or safety issue, your psychologist can send emergency help to your location. Please turn off any applications and notifications for the duration of your session. Ensure you have updated anti-viral and anti-malware software.
  </p>
  <h5>What can my therapist provide?</h5>
  <p>
    I understand that my therapist is a professional who is able to work with me to determine my goals and make a plan to address barriers to achieving them based on evidence supported therapy techniques. My therapist may assess symptoms and challenges but will not be providing me with a diagnosis or documentation as to prognosis as this is outside of the scope for many psychotherapists. What my theorist will do is create an individualized assessment, conceptualize together with me to help us both understand what I am seeking to change, and make an individualized plan for how to help me achieve my therapy goals. The therapist will then help me learn new tools and techniques for reducing barriers to my goals and will help me put them into action in my life. My therapist will check in with me regularly on how therapy is progressing and continue to tailor the approach to find what works for me.
  </p>
  <h5>Tracking my Progress</h5>
  <p>
    It is useful for both myself and my therapist to track my progress to determine if adjustments need to be made to the therapy, or if things are progressing as hoped for. One way of doing this is through periodically filling out questionnaires that reliably measure specific aspects of the thing that brought me to therapy. (fill in here any specifics about this when we decide about them - ex. the therapist might periodically track this in session and review progress with you, or we could introduce things like greenspace here, or other method of tracking outcomes.)
  </p>
  <h5>In the Event of Crisis or Emergency</h5>
  <p>
    I understand that my therapist is not available for emergencies. Should I need to speak to someone immediately or find myself in the midst of a crisis, I agreed to access services from my local emergency room or crisis intervention program as appropriate.
  </p>
  <h5>
    Communication with my Therapist
  </h5>
  <p>
    I acknowledge that should I receive text or email contact information, my therapist will not include any personal health information in text or email. My therapist will limit communication to appointment times using text or email, with the exception of emailing blank worksheets or password protected post session documents as attachments. Any personal health information sent via email will be password protected.
  </p>
  <p>
    Emails will be responded to based on therapist availability and response is not guaranteed.
  </p>
  <h5>Clinical Internship Program</h5>
  <p>Alli Therapy offers a clinical internship program for therapists-in-training.</p>
  <p>Occasionally, and with your verbal consent, your therapist may invite an intern to shadow them throughout your session. Additionally, your therapist may request that your session be recorded for training purposes. You have the right to decline. This recording will be stored on our PHIPA compliant platform and automatically deleted after 30 days. Alli Therapy values your ongoing consent and consent may be revoked at any time.</p>
  <h5>Therapy With A Practicum Therapist</h5>
  <p>*This is only applicable if I am seeking counselling from a practicum therapist.</p>
  <p>
    Practicum therapists are required to conduct therapy under supervision of a registered therapist.
  </p>
  <p>
    I grant permission for my practicum therapist to discuss my sessions with the supervising therapist as needed, and I grant permission for the supervising therapist to observe my sessions with the practicum therapist from time to time when necessary.
  </p>
  <h5>
    Informed Consent
  </h5>
  <p>
    I have read this document in its entirety and been given an opportunity to review and ask questions of my therapist. By signing, I am consenting to the terms and information contained in this document, and consenting to provision of counselling and psychotherapy services.
  </p>
  <p>
    I understand that in accordance with the Health Care Consent Act, consent must be informed, meaning that to consent I must understand fully the consequences of giving or withholding consent to engage in these services. If I cannot fully comprehend the nature and consequences of giving consent, a parent, legal guardian or substitute decision maker may do this in my place.
  </p>
  <p>
    I agree that should I consent electronically; my electronic consent will be as legally binding as my handwritten signature. I will not claim otherwise in future.
